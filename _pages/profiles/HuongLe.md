# About me 

Currently, I am finishing my PhD at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico. The title of my doctoral thesis is "Copula-based modeling for petrophysical property prediction using seismic attributes as secondary variables".

Main Research Interests:
- Geostatistical (spatial stochastic) simulation based on copulas and global optimization methods (simulated annealing, differential evolution).
- Integration methodology of different quantitative and qualitative information based on advanced geostatistical methods for reservoir characterization.
- Inverse theory and optimization: Bayesian and geostatistical inversion.
- Machine learning with a deep understanding of geostatistical analysis.
- Petrophysical seismic inversion based on advanced geostatistical methods and quantification of uncertainty.
- Rock physics.
