# About me 

PhD student at the Earth Sciences Graduate Program, UNAM.

Main Research Interests:
- Geostatistical (spatial stochastic) simulation based on copulas and global optimization methods (simulated annealing, differential evolution).
- Integration methodology of different quantitative and qualitative information based on advanced geostatistical methods for reservoir characterization.
- Inverse theory and optimization: Bayesian and geostatistical inversion.
- Machine learning with a deep understanding of geostatistical analysis.
- Petrophysical seismic inversion based on advanced geostatistical methods and quantification of uncertainty.
- Rock physics.
